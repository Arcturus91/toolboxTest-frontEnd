  Gatsby's personal blog starter
</h1>



This starter is a fork of Gatsby Starter Blog, the most popular starter by far â€“ with second place being Gatsby Starter Netlify CMS. So I decided to combine the 2!

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```
